# Are you looking to order bridal outfit from Faiza Saqlain ?

#### You might want to think twice.

I ordered my wedding outfit from this Pakistan-based company and confirmed it'd be ready by a certain date.
When [faizasaqlain](https://www.faizasaqlain.pk/) failed to deliver within 45 days as agreed, instead of admitting it and
refunding me, they just change the delivery date to 55 days.

Having bought shoes, churiya and earrings to match that outfit, which is still nowhere to be seen at the time of writing,
**I'm now back on the Upton Park streets for the hunt one week before my wedding.**

They have spent time working on their website and brand but fail to understand basic customer service, even basic human manners!
They are polite and and lie to you before you purchase an item.
I asked them if they could guarantee my dress to be delivered by 24th July 2021. I made my purchase on 31st May. 
I asked them before purchasing if they would be able to meet the deadline especially with Eid. But they told me it was fine.
Once I placed my order they kept lying to me saying it was being made. It would be dispatched mid July.
They only started responding to me when I went on Trust pilot and left a review and bombarded their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/faizasaqlain/?hl=en) with messages(I know this sounds terrible but it was a last resort after waiting weeks).
They informed me that the outfit was not ready and refused at first to give me a refund. 
If you find yourself in the same situation I would advise you to go on [Trust Pilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/faizasaqlain.pk) they will then respond. Or like I did just bombard their Instragm. They clearly canâ€™t stand their influencer aesthetic being ruined. 
It is a shame because they have amazing clothes. If they had told me the truth a few weeks before hand I would have been happy to accept a refund. Now my wedding is days away and I have no outfit thanks to this brand that clearly thinks it can get away with just looking good.
