# Are you looking to order some outfits from faizasaqlain ?

You might want to think twice.

I ordered my wedding outfit from them and confirmed it'd be ready by a certain date.
When [faizasaqlain](https://www.faizasaqlain.pk/) failed to deliver within 44 days as agreed, instead of admitting it and
refunding me, they just change the delivery date to 55 days.

Having bought shoes, churiya and earrings to match that outfit, which is still nowhere to be seen at the time of writing,
**I'm now back on the Upton Park streets for the hunt one week before my wedding.**

They make their website all shiny and come across as professionals when you haven't made the purchase. Once you've placed
the order, they immediately go back to crappy customer service and couldn't care less about the impacts it'd have on you.

I'm not the only one, check out the testimonials of other people that have had the same experience as me.

If you were also a victim of this greedy company, please reach out to my friend that maintains this website and
help us expose them so that other people don't fall into their trap.
